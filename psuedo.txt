create a code quiz game

the quiz game is timed

there is a game-clock that counts down to zero

there is a start button

the game-clock starts when start button is clicked

I am also presented with the first question when start button is clicked

all questions are multiple choice

when I answer a question correctly, I am presented with the next question

when I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the game-clock

the game is completed when all of the questions are answered or when the clock reaches zero

when the game is complete, I can save my initials and my score



how many questions?

what types of coding should the questions include?     just stick to JS 

how many seconds does the game-clock start with?     60 seconds per question

how many seconds are subtracted from the game-clock for an incorrect answer?     subtract 30 seconds


** start the code quiz game with one multiple choice question.  make the game work with one question
and the game-clock
